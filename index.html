               I am a San Diego native studying computer science and business at University of San Diego.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, I am looking for an internship that focuses on artificial intelligence, machine learning,
                data engineering, or anything in between. In the summer of 2023, I was an automation engineering intern
                at San Diego based company Trilink Biotechnologies which is apart of Maravai LifeSciences. I was thoroughly
                exposed to the importance of automating processes through scripting and grew my interest in working
                with data. With my interest in business and sustainability, I am interested in working at a financial
                institution or a company dedicated to green practices. 
      
               </p>
               <p>
                In my freetime, I am an outdoor enthusiast who enjoys camping and hiking. I would love to visit
                as many national parks as I can. My music taste consists of a wide range of artists and I am always
                open to exploring new artists. I also enjoy playing tennis and pickleball and going on runs and 
                taking workout classes to stay active.

              <h3>Car Rental System</h3>
              <p>
               This project simulates the process of renting out a car through an interactive GUI utilizing 
               properties of object-oriented design. The drive behind the idea was the interest in how filtering
               systems work on websites, both the backend and frontend. Creating this program was a way to 
               explore real world implementation of a feature that we so often use. 
              </p>
              <p>
              The user can utilize the guest or administrator interface which both present different features
              for navigating the car repository through filtering through car objects. Through the usage of a simple
              filtering system that is visualized in the GUI, a user can quickly narrow down options of the 
              car they would like to lease. Guests can easily navigate through the leasing process through 
              specifying the attributes of the car or by searching using license plate number. Administrators are also
              able to view the inventory count of cars as well as the sales. They also have access to cars that have 
              already been leased out. When clicked on, cars display their additional details such as 
              price, color, model, etc. 
              </p>
              <p>
              Car Rental System was coded using Python progamming language and the GUI was progammed using
              PYSimpleGUI. Python offers a diverse range of libraries and features and great versatility. 
              We based the design of the program through familiar features that are available within car rental
              sites online. We broke down the program into different sections that each handled specific functions
              so we could decide how we would update the interface. The usefulness of object oriented design proves
              to be the backbone of our project as we utilized concepts and principles for efficient code. 

              </p>
              <p>
              I worked on the backend code which handles the cars and filter dropdowns and worked alongside
              my partners to integrate that with the interactive console to display the correct information
              onto the user's screen. Using test driven development, I was able to individually test several
              interfaces by utilizing Python's MagicMock feature to ensure accuracy of data. We operated using
              the Model-View-Controller model to plan out the relationship between the data, user interface,
              and the logic in handling the two. Additionally, the State design pattern served as a way to create
              the distinct admin and guest features. Through paired-programming, my teammates and I were able to
              communicate effectively on uniting our code together into one system and continously alter our 
              program to create the most effective and functional design from eachother's feedback.
